# Pathological sentenceas.
# Any line that begins with #C is the beginning of a sentence.  The text from the C to the first white space
# is a sentence name, which typically would be a counter.
# Any line that begins with a # is a comment.
# All other lines are pathological sentences.
# A parenthesis pair introduces a comment about why the sentence is pathological.
# If there is a string in the parenthesis pair enclosed in double quotes, then the string is the sentence re-written so that it is not pathological.

A woman, without her man, is nothing.  (punctuated by males)
A woman: without her, man is nothing.  (punctuated by females)
Once, I thought I was thinking, but after thinking about it, I thought I was not thinking at all.
I'm glad you're thinking: I think that's thoughtful.
And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat; when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to cause an offering made by fire to smoke unto HaShem; (Exodus 30:19-20.  Archaic English.  Also, the sentence is a careful reflection of the Hebrew, to be a better English sentence, it should be written "Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet, they shall wash with water, that they not die when they come near to the altar to minister or when [they] cause an offering made by fire to smoke unto HaShem.)
These truths we hold to be self evident.

The janitor opened the door.
The chancelor
